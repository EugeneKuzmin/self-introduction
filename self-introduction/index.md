Hello everybody!

I'm Eugene!

I'm a junior front developer, actualy I'm doing the course at the moment and I want to be better version of myself at this skill.
Talking about by background, it includes  a bachelor’s degree, as a math and computer science teacher, plus I have a TEFL certificate from a 120 hour TEFL course, and I have IELTS certificat but it's a little bit outdated. 
Concerning my career path for the whole my life I've been either teaching maths and english or I've been working as a programmer. I worked 11 years as 1c programmer. It's an accounting system it includes different types of accounting: wharehouse, bookeeping or something. I worked 3 yers  as techer of maths and english in different countries. Russia, Ukrane, China, Thailand. As I've already said for the last 7 months I'v been taking a course from rolling scopes team for front developers.

Since my childhood I always loved solving problems. Doing math Working with abstraction. When I do it I forget about everything.  And how wonderfull it is, to have a practical implementation of this skill. I mean programming. Not only I can figure out somethig for myself but also the solution that sugest can help people other people with their problems. it's fabulous isn't it? Fields where you can apply this knowlige and overcome problems are quite various. It's graphic, calculation, whatever. Just every time you see a problem bare in mind that the solution that you sugest can help other people. It's not about monitezation or startup or in order to obtain a qualification leading to a lucrative job，it's just about what inspires you to wake every morning. It's just for its own sake. 

Do not compare yourself to others. The thing is what you feel about it. But on the other hand we all live in a human lives in society and  all work for businesses, which is quite selective and competitive. So we all should be very effictive. It's kind of a balance we should live in.
My recent project was about accounting and planning working hours for workers in one of the factories. It was developed with use differen framowok. Which was very interesting  basicly Vue ecosistem. And was quite interesting for me to get known how to create a webpage with SPA technolgy. It's kind of splitting the whole web page on different pieces, and organizing the communication between them. Like building an architecture.
